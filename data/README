How 'nominal_appositives.csv' dataset were created:

We created an additional dataset that included an ellided structure, a nominal appositive. We did this by transforming the content in VP1 columns in the existing dataset. This transformation process involved primarily three steps, creating a new column called 'nominal_appositive.'

First, identify the most semantically informative content word in VP1. Next, convert it into a human-denoting noun phrase. This can be a profession, a description of a person, or a social role. When the content was not informative, we created noun phrases as "the sister/son of X." Thirdly, optionally add a description or attribute of the noun phrase. Finally, since nominal appositives will be responded with "is" unless the content refers to a past event, we included prefixed the content with words such as "once", "formerly", or "previously" to make the response be able to begin wtih "was." Recall that some VP2 can be responded with "is" (e.g., "is a famous chef"). So if the model responds with "is", without the edit in the nominal appositive content, we cannot distinguish if it is referring to VP2 or the nominal appositive content. With this modification, in this dataset, the verb1 column will either be "is" or "was."

For example, we chose the most salient content in "missed a train this morning" to be "train," and based on this keyword, we came up with phrases like "a train enthusiast." Another example: "used to play badminton" -> "badminton" -> "a retired badminton player". Another example: "recently adopted a rescue dog" -> "a committed volunteer for rescue dogs". Another example: "opened a new bank account tody" -> "a new client at Citibank". Another example: "used to dream to become a translater" -> "once a translator".
